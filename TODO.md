# TODO: Fix React Import and Button Color in Orders.jsx

- [ ] Remove 'React' from the import statement in Orders.jsx (unnecessary in React 19 with new JSX transform)
- [ ] Change button background color from bg-blue-600 to bg-blue-800 for a darker blue
- [ ] Test the changes by running the dev server and verifying the page
